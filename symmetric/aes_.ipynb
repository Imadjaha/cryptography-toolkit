    "# AES — Advanced Encryption Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "AES is the modern standard symmetric-key block cipher that has replaced DES/3DES in nearly every application. It is valued for its speed, robustness, and extensive support in both hardware and software.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Block Size:** 128 bits (16 bytes)\n",
    "- **Key Sizes:** 128, 192, or 256 bits (the same key is used for both encryption and decryption)\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Rapid encryption/decryption in hardware and software\n",
    "- **Security:** Highly secure when used with recommended modes and proper key management\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "AES uses a substitution–permutation network that processes data in rounds. The number of rounds depends on the chosen key size:\n",
    "- **AES-128:** 10 rounds\n",
    "- **AES-192:** 12 rounds\n",
    "- **AES-256:** 14 rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round consists of:\n",
    "1. **SubBytes:** A nonlinear byte substitution using an S-box.\n",
    "2. **ShiftRows:** A cyclic permutation of the rows in the state array.\n",
    "3. **MixColumns:** A mixing process that operates on the columns of the state.\n",
    "4. **AddRoundKey:** A bitwise XOR of the state with the round key.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Decryption is performed by applying the inverse of these operations in reverse order._\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The underlying mathematics is complex. In practice, always use a trusted cryptographic library for AES operations.\n",

    "## Communication Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Alice                          Bob                          Eve\n",
    "-----                          ---                          ---\n",
    "Plaintext P\n",
    "  | -- Encrypt with key K -->  Ciphertext C\n",
    "  |                     | -- Decrypt with key K -->\n",
    "  |                     |                     |\n",
    "  |                     |                     V\n",
    "  |                     |               Plaintext P\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alice:** Encrypts the plaintext (P) using AES with key (K).\n",
    "- **Bob:** Decrypts the ciphertext (C) using the same key (K).\n",
    "- **Eve:** Can observe the ciphertext, but without the secret key, she cannot reveal the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters and Modes of Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Block Size:** 128 bits (fixed)\n",
    "- **Key Sizes:** 128, 192, or 256 bits\n",
    "- **Modes of Operation:** ECB, CBC, CTR, GCM, etc.\n",
    "  - **IV/Nonce:** Most modes require an initialization vector (IV) or nonce. This must be unique and random for every encryption instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid ECB Mode:** ECB is not recommended due to its tendency to reveal data patterns.\n",
    "- **Prefer AEAD Modes:** Use authenticated modes like AES-GCM or AES-CCM to ensure both confidentiality and integrity.\n",
    "- **Unique IV/Nonce:** Always generate a **new, random IV/nonce** for each encryption to prevent attacks.\n",
    "- **Key Management:** Securely generate and store keys; use cryptographically strong random sources.\n",
    "- **Key Length Choice:** AES-128 is very secure; use AES-256 only if required by policy or for additional security margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of AES\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TLS/HTTPS:** Securing web traffic.\n",
    "- **Messaging:** Used in secure messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal.\n",
    "- **VPNs & Wi-Fi:** Common in VPN encryption and Wi-Fi protocols like WPA2/WPA3.\n",
    "- **Financial Transactions:** Employed in payment systems and other secure financial communications."
