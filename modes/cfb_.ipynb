    "# CFB Mode (Cipher Feedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "CFB (Cipher Feedback) is a mode of operation that converts a block cipher (such as AES) into a stream cipher. It enables the encryption of data in segments (even bit-by-bit or byte-by-byte) without requiring padding, making it suitable for encrypting messages of arbitrary lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - **IV:** A random, unique Initialization Vector is generated.\n",
    "   - **First Keystream Block:**  \n",
    "     `O₁ = Eₖ(IV)`  \n",
    "     Here, `Eₖ` denotes encryption with key **K**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Block-by-Block Encryption:**\n",
    "   - For the first plaintext segment **P₁**:  \n",
    "     `C₁ = P₁ ⊕ O₁`\n",
    "   - For subsequent segments, the previous ciphertext is fed back:\n",
    "     - Compute:  \n",
    "       `O₂ = Eₖ(C₁)`  \n",
    "       Then,  \n",
    "       `C₂ = P₂ ⊕ O₂`\n",
    "     - Continue similarly for further blocks:\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       O₃ = Eₖ(C₂)\n",
    "       C₃ = P₃ ⊕ O₃\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decryption Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Decryption follows the same process using the same key and IV:\n",
    "- **For the first ciphertext segment:**  \n",
    "  `P₁ = C₁ ⊕ Eₖ(IV)`\n",
    "- **For subsequent segments:**  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  P₂ = C₂ ⊕ Eₖ(C₁)\n",
    "  P₃ = C₃ ⊕ Eₖ(C₂)\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since XOR is its own inverse, encrypting and decrypting are performed using the identical process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Alice                            Bob                          Eve\n",
    "-----                            ---                          ---\n",
    "Plaintext (P)\n",
    "   | -- Encrypt using AES-CFB (with key K & IV) -->\n",
    "   |                Produces Ciphertext (C)\n",
    "   | <-- Decrypt using same K & IV -- \n",
    "Plaintext (P)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Note:**  \n",
    "  Eve can observe the ciphertext but cannot decrypt it without knowing the secret key **K**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key (K):**  \n",
    "  AES key of 128, 192, or 256 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IV (Initialization Vector):**  \n",
    "  A random, unique value for each encryption session.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segment Size:**  \n",
    "  - Typically the block size (e.g., 128 bits for AES).  \n",
    "  - Can be adjusted to smaller sizes (e.g., 8 bits per segment) for stream-like behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - **No Padding Required:**  \n",
    "    Able to encrypt messages of arbitrary length.\n",
    "  - **Stream Cipher Behavior:**  \n",
    "    Suitable for real-time or variable-length data transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Risks:**\n",
    "  - **IV Reuse:**  \n",
    "    Must never reuse the same (key, IV) pair; doing so reuses the keystream and compromises security.\n",
    "  - **Error Propagation:**  \n",
    "    A single bit error in a ciphertext segment corrupts that segment and the next one.\n",
    "  - **Lack of Authentication:**  \n",
    "    CFB does not provide message integrity. It is advisable to combine it with an HMAC or use an authenticated encryption mode (such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Context\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Historical Applications:**  \n",
    "  - Early secure communication protocols.\n",
    "  - Systems requiring streaming encryption without padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modern Alternatives:**  \n",
    "  - CTR mode for parallel processing.\n",
    "  - AEAD modes (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305) for combined confidentiality and integrity."
