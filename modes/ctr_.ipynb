    "# CTR Mode (Counter Mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "CTR mode converts a block cipher (e.g., AES) into a stream cipher. Instead of directly encrypting message blocks, it generates a keystream by encrypting sequential counter values combined with a nonce, then XORs this keystream with the plaintext. Since encryption and decryption are symmetric (both use XOR), the same algorithm applies for both processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallelizable:**  \n",
    "  Multiple blocks can be processed in parallel, making CTR mode faster than modes like CBC.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **No Padding Needed:**  \n",
    "  As a stream cipher, plaintext does not require padding.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Identical Operations:**  \n",
    "  Encryption and decryption are performed by the same XOR operation using the keystream.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keystream Generation:**  \n",
    "   - A unique **nonce** (or IV) is generated for each encryption.\n",
    "   - A **counter** is used (commonly starting at 0) and incremented for each block.\n",
    "   - For each block, the cipher computes:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Keystream_i = E_K(Nonce || Counter_i)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     where `E_K` is the block cipher encryption with key K.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encrypting/Decrypting Data:**  \n",
    "   - **Encryption:**  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Ciphertext = Plaintext ⊕ Keystream\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Decryption:**  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Plaintext = Ciphertext ⊕ Keystream\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   Since XOR is its own inverse, the same operation recovers the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Alice                               Bob                    Eve\n",
    "-----                               ---                    ---\n",
    "Plaintext P\n",
    "   | -- Encrypt using CTR with key K and nonce N --> Ciphertext C\n",
    "   |                                                   (Eve sees C and N)\n",
    "   | -- Decrypt using same key K and nonce N --> Plaintext P\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eve’s Limitations:**  \n",
    "  Without knowing the secret key K, having access to the nonce N and ciphertext C does not reveal any information about the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key (K):**  \n",
    "  Can be AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonce (IV):**  \n",
    "  A random, unique value for each encryption; it must never be reused with the same key.  \n",
    "  *Tip:* The nonce and counter are typically concatenated to form the block input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counter:**  \n",
    "  A value that is incremented for each block; ensures that each keystream block is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Block Size:**  \n",
    "  128 bits for AES.\n",

    "## Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**  \n",
    "  - High performance due to parallelization.  \n",
    "  - Eliminates padding overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical Requirements:**  \n",
    "  - **Unique Nonce:** Reusing a nonce with the same key leads to keystream reuse, which can catastrophically compromise security.\n",
    "  - **No Built-In Integrity:**  \n",
    "    CTR mode does not provide message authentication. Always combine it with a MAC (or use an AEAD mode like AES-GCM) for integrity.\n",
    "  - ⚠️ If nonce is reused with the same key, attacker can XOR two ciphertexts to cancel keystream → dangerous!\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TLS/HTTPS:**  \n",
    "  Often used as part of the encryption process (e.g., AES-CTR or as a basis for AES-GCM).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Disk Encryption:**  \n",
    "  Suitable for streaming encryption of files or disks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Foundation for AEAD Modes:**  \n",
    "  CTR mode underpins advanced modes like GCM, which combine encryption and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "CTR mode is a versatile and efficient encryption mode that turns block ciphers into stream ciphers. Its speed and parallelizability make it ideal for high-throughput applications, provided that nonce reuse is strictly avoided and additional measures (like MACs) are implemented for integrity."
