    "# RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is the most famous public-key cryptosystem. It can be used for both encryption (ensuring confidentiality) and digital signatures (ensuring authenticity). In RSA, each user has a public key (shared openly) and a private key (kept secret). Anyone can encrypt a message for Bob using his public key, but only Bob can decrypt it with his private key. Without Bob's private key, an attacker cannot recover the original message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works (High Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Generation\n",
    "1. **Choose Two Primes:** Select two large random prime numbers, `p` and `q`.\n",
    "2. **Compute the Modulus:** Calculate `N = p * q`.\n",
    "3. **Compute Euler’s Totient:** Compute `φ(N) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)`.\n",
    "4. **Select Public Exponent:** Choose an integer `e`, commonly `65537`. `e` should be coprime to `φ(N)`; otherwise, `d` will not exist.\n",
    "5. **Compute Private Exponent:** Compute `d` such that `d ≡ e⁻¹ (mod φ(N))`.\n",
    "6. **Keys:**\n",
    "   - **Public Key:** `(N, e)`\n",
    "   - **Private Key:** `(N, d)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption (Performed by Alice)\n",
    "- **Encryption Formula:**  \n",
    "  Given a message `m` (an integer where 0 < m < n), compute the ciphertext:  \n",
    "  `C = m^e mod n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decryption (Performed by Bob)\n",
    "- **Decryption Formula:**  \n",
    "  Recover the original message from the ciphertext using:  \n",
    "  `m = C^d mod N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N:** Modulus (public), the product of two large primes.\n",
    "- **e:** Public exponent (public), typically set to `65537`.\n",
    "- **d:** Private exponent (secret).\n",
    "- **m:** Message as an integer, where `0 < m < N`.\n",
    "- **C:** Ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Padding is Critical:**  \n",
    "  Always use a padding scheme like OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) when encrypting messages.  \n",
    "  Avoid using the simple `m^e mod N` formulation as it is insecure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Sizes:**  \n",
    "  RSA key sizes of at least 2048 bits are recommended for secure communications.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Modern Alternatives:**  \n",
    "  Although RSA is secure when properly implemented with padding, many modern systems prefer Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) methods for improved efficiency and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where It’s Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TLS/HTTPS:**  \n",
    "  RSA is used in certificates and for securing connections (although newer versions use alternative key exchange mechanisms).\n",
    "  RSA used only in TLS 1.2 and earlier and is being deprecated in TLS 1.3 because it is not forward-secure (if the private key is compromised, past communications can be decrypted).\n",
    "- **Secure Email:**  \n",
    "  Implemented in PGP/GPG for encrypted communication.\n",
    "- **Digital Signatures:**  \n",
    "  Widely employed in various standards to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages."
