    "# scrypt (Password Hashing)\n",
    "\n",
    "scrypt is a password hashing function designed by Colin Percival in 2009. It was created to be memory-hard, which forces attackers using GPUs or ASICs to expend a lot of RAM during a brute-force attack, thereby making such attacks significantly slower and more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory-Hard:**  \n",
    "  scrypt requires significant memory, which helps mitigate attacks from massively parallel hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configurable Parameters:**  \n",
    "  - **N (Cost Factor):** A power of 2 (e.g., 2^14 = 16384) that defines the CPU and memory cost.\n",
    "  - **r (Block Size):** Usually set to 8.\n",
    "  - **p (Parallelism):** The number of parallel computational threads (e.g., 1).\n",
    "  - **dkLen (Derived Key Length):** The length (in bytes) of the output hash (e.g., 32 bytes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-In Salt Generation:**  \n",
    "  A unique, random salt (typically 16+ bytes) is used to thwart precomputed rainbow table attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security Tradeoffs:**  \n",
    "  While scrypt is stronger than bcrypt against GPU/ASIC attacks due to its memory hardness, the newer Argon2id is generally recommended for even stronger security.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How scrypt Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:**  \n",
    "   The function takes a user's password and a unique salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PBKDF2 Preprocessing:**  \n",
    "   It uses PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA-256 to generate initial key material.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory-Hard Mixing:**  \n",
    "   The algorithm fills a large memory array with pseudorandom data and repeatedly mixes it. This step is deliberately resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compression:**  \n",
    "   The mixed data is then compressed to produce the final derived key (hash).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication Flow (Registration and Login Scenario)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Registration:**\n",
    "   - **User Input:**  \n",
    "     Alice chooses a password, e.g., `\"mypassword\"`.\n",
    "   - **Hashing:**  \n",
    "     scrypt generates a hash using the password, a random salt, and configured parameters.\n",
    "   - **Storage:**  \n",
    "     The resultant hash (with embedded parameters and salt) is stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Login:**\n",
    "   - **Password Submission:**  \n",
    "     Alice inputs her password.\n",
    "   - **Verification:**  \n",
    "     The system re-computes the scrypt hash with the stored salt and parameters.\n",
    "   - **Matching:**  \n",
    "     If the computed hash matches the stored value, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attack Resistance:**  \n",
    "   Even if an attacker steals the database, the memory-heavy computation makes brute-forcing scrypt hashes extremely resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Password:** User-provided input.\n",
    "- **Salt:** A random, unique salt (recommended 16+ bytes).\n",
    "- **N (Cost Factor):** Specifies CPU/memory cost (e.g., 2^14 = 16384).\n",
    "- **r (Block Size):** Typically 8.\n",
    "- **p (Parallelism):** Number of parallel threads, such as 1.\n",
    "- **dkLen:** Desired length of the derived key in bytes (e.g., 32).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stronger than bcrypt:**  \n",
    "  scryptâ€™s memory-hard design offers improved resistance against brute-force attacks using specialized hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Sensitivity:**  \n",
    "  Incorrect parameter choices (too low N, r, or p) can weaken security. Choose values that balance security with acceptable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Best Practice:**  \n",
    "  Though scrypt remains secure when properly configured, Argon2id is generally recommended for new applications due to its improved design and resistance to side-channel attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cryptocurrency Wallets:**  \n",
    "  Used for key derivation in some wallets (e.g., Litecoin, Dogecoin).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure Password Storage:**  \n",
    "  Adopted by various libraries and systems for storing hashed passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Derivation for File Encryption:**  \n",
    "  Applied in scenarios where a derived key is used to encrypt files.\n",
