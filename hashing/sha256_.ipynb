    "# SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions, standardized by NIST in 2001. It transforms any input into a fixed 256‑bit (32‑byte) digest, ensuring data integrity and authentication. SHA-256 is involved by the U.S. government and widely used in various security applications and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic:**  \n",
    "  Same input always yields the same output.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **One-Way:**  \n",
    "  Reversing the hash to recover the original input is computationally infeasible.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Collision-Resistant:**  \n",
    "  It is extremely difficult to find two distinct inputs that produce the same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing:**  \n",
    "   - **Padding and Parsing:** The input message is padded to a multiple of 512 bits and split into 512‑bit blocks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Processing:**  \n",
    "   - **Rounds of Transformations:** Each block goes through 64 rounds of operations involving bitwise functions (e.g., XOR, shifts, rotations) and modular additions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Digest Calculation:**  \n",
    "   - **State Update:** An internal state is updated with each block, and after processing all blocks, the final 256‑bit digest is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You typically use a cryptographic library for SHA-256 instead of implementing it by hand.\n",

    "## Communication Flow Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Bob                         Alice                        Eve\n",
    "---                         -----                        ---\n",
    "File F\n",
    "  | -- Compute SHA-256 -->   Digest H\n",
    "                            Compare with her own computed H\n",
    "                            If match → file integrity confirmed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Eve may alter the file, but without being able to generate a matching hash, the tampering will be detected.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:**  \n",
    "  Any-length message (text, binary, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  A 256‑bit digest (commonly displayed as 64 hexadecimal characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Security:**  \n",
    "  SHA-256 remains secure and is widely trusted for integrity verification.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Use Cases:**  \n",
    "  - Data integrity checks\n",
    "  - Digital signatures\n",
    "  - Blockchain and cryptocurrency applications\n",
    "  - TLS/HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not for Password Hashing:**  \n",
    "  Use dedicated algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blockchain:**  \n",
    "  Underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Web Security:**  \n",
    "  Used in TLS/HTTPS and certificate authentication.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Digital Signatures:**  \n",
    "  Forms part of schemes such as RSA-PSS, ECDSA, and EdDSA.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **File Integrity Verification:**  \n",
    "  Used as a checksum to verify that files have not been altered.\n",

    "For implementation, always rely on reputable cryptographic libraries to ensure robustness"
