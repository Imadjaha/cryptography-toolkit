    "# Argon2 (Password Hashing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Argon2 is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition (PHC) and is widely regarded as the modern best practice for password hashing. Its memory-hard design forces attackers to use large amounts of RAM, making brute-force attacks with GPUs or ASICs significantly more difficult and costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory-Hard:**  \n",
    "  Requires significant but configurable memory to compute the hash, thwarting parallel attacks on specialized hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configurable Parameters:**  \n",
    "  You can adjust the:\n",
    "  - **Time Cost:** Number of iterations (passes).\n",
    "  - **Memory Cost:** Amount of RAM (in KB) used during hashing.\n",
    "  - **Parallelism:** Number of threads (lanes) involved.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Built-In Salt:**  \n",
    "  Automatically generates a random salt (recommended: 16 bytes) to protect against rainbow table attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variants:**  \n",
    "  - **Argon2d:** Strong against GPU cracking, but more vulnerable to side-channel attacks.\n",
    "  - **Argon2i:** Optimized for password hashing against side-channel attacks.\n",
    "  - **Argon2id:** A hybrid of Argon2d and Argon2i; recommended for general password hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:**  \n",
    "   The user's plain-text password is combined with a random salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Filling:**  \n",
    "   Argon2 allocates a large memory matrix (based on the configured memory cost) and fills it with pseudo-random data derived from the password and salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Passes:**  \n",
    "   The algorithm makes several passes over the memory matrix (as specified by the time cost), mixing the data intensively to increase computational difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Hash:**  \n",
    "   A final block is computed and compressed into a fixed-length hash that encapsulates all the parameters (version, memory cost, time cost, salt, and hash).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verification:**  \n",
    "   To verify a password, Argon2 repeats the process using the stored parameters, then compares the computed hash with the stored hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication Flow (Registration & Login)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Registration:**\n",
    "   - **Password Creation:** Alice chooses a password (e.g., `\"mypassword\"`).\n",
    "   - **Hashing:** The system hashes the password using Argon2id with a generated salt and configured parameters.\n",
    "   - **Storage:** The complete hash string (including all parameters) is saved in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Login:**\n",
    "   - **Password Submission:** Alice enters her password.\n",
    "   - **Verification:** The system hashes the provided password using the same parameters as stored and compares the result with the stored hash.\n",
    "     - **Match:** Login successful.\n",
    "     - **Mismatch:** Login denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Even if an attacker steals the database, cracking the hashes becomes extremely slow and resource intensive due to Argon2's memory-hard properties.*\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Password:** User's plain-text input.\n",
    "- **Salt:** A random (recommended: 16-byte) value generated automatically.\n",
    "- **Time Cost:** Number of iterations (e.g., 2).\n",
    "- **Memory Cost:** Memory required in KB (e.g., 65536 KB for 64 MB).\n",
    "- **Parallelism:** Number of threads (e.g., 4).\n",
    "- **Hash Length:** Length of the output hash (e.g., 32 bytes).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **State-of-the-Art:**  \n",
    "  Argon2, especially Argon2id, is considered the best practice for password hashing as of 2025.\n",
    "- **Memory-Hard Design:**  \n",
    "  Its design makes it significantly more resistant to brute-force attacks using GPUs or ASICs than older algorithms like bcrypt.\n",
    "- **Parameter Tuning:**  \n",
    "  Adjust the time cost, memory cost, and parallelism settings to balance security with the performance of your system.\n",
    "- **Recommended Variant:**  \n",
    "  Use **Argon2id** for general password hashing as it combines the strengths of Argon2d and Argon2i.\n",
