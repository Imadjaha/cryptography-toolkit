    "# bcrypt (Password Hashing)\n",
    "\n",
    "bcrypt is a password hashing algorithm based on the Blowfish cipher, created in 1999. It is designed specifically for secure password storage by making each hash computation intentionally slow to hinder brute-force attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in Salt:**  \n",
    "  Automatically generates a 16-byte random salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Factor (Work Factor):**  \n",
    "  Configurable parameter (e.g., 12 means 2^12 iterations) that controls the hashing speed. A higher cost factor increases security at the expense of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash Format:**  \n",
    "  Produces a 60-character string containing the version, cost factor, salt, and hashed password. For example:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  $2b$12$saltsaltsaltsaltsalt$hashedPasswordValue...\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slow by Design:**  \n",
    "  The deliberate slowness makes brute-force password cracking computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How bcrypt Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Password Input:**  \n",
    "   A user chooses a plain-text password.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Salt Generation:**  \n",
    "   bcrypt generates a unique, random 16-byte salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hashing Process:**  \n",
    "   The password and salt are combined and processed through an expensive key schedule based on the Blowfish cipher for a number of iterations determined by the cost factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**  \n",
    "   The result is a secure hash string that encapsulates all necessary parameters (version, cost factor, salt, and hash).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verification:**  \n",
    "   To verify a password, bcrypt rehashes the provided password using the same salt and cost factor, then compares the result with the stored hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication Flow (Login Scenario)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Registration:**\n",
    "   - Alice chooses a password, e.g., `\"mypassword\"`.\n",
    "   - bcrypt hashes the password and stores the resulting hash in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Login:**\n",
    "   - Alice enters her password.\n",
    "   - The system hashes the entered password using the stored salt and cost factor.\n",
    "   - The new hash is compared to the stored hash:\n",
    "     - **Match:** Access is granted.\n",
    "     - **Mismatch:** Access is denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attack Resistance:**\n",
    "   - If an attacker (Eve) steals the database, she sees only bcrypt hashes—not the plain-text passwords. Due to the salt and the high cost factor, cracking these hashes is very slow and costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Password:**  \n",
    "  The plain-text input provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salt:**  \n",
    "  A randomly generated 16-byte value automatically incorporated into the hashing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Factor:**  \n",
    "  The number of rounds (e.g., cost factor 12 corresponds to 2^12 iterations) used to intensify the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash Output:**  \n",
    "  A 60-character string that includes all required information to verify a password.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "# Cost Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "> cost = number of hashing rounds = 2^cost\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "| Cost | Time (approx) | Notes |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 10 | 100–300ms | Common default |\n",
    "| 12 | 500–800ms | More secure |\n",
    "| 14+ | 1–2 sec | Stronger, but slower login UX |\n",
    "\n",
    "> Choose a cost that takes ~500ms to 1 second on your current hardware.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in Salt:**  \n",
    "  Defends against rainbow table and precomputed attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configurable Cost:**  \n",
    "  Allows adjustment of computational effort to remain secure as hardware improves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not Memory-Hard:**  \n",
    "  bcrypt does not require a large amount of memory, making it somewhat less resistant to GPU/ASIC-based attacks compared to memory-hard functions like Argon2id.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage Recommendation:**  \n",
    "  Whenever possible, use Argon2id for enhanced resistance against specialized hardware attacks; bcrypt remains a secure and widely adopted alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where bcrypt Is Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Applications:**  \n",
    "  Widely used for securely storing user passwords in online services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linux/Unix Systems:**  \n",
    "  Often utilized in `/etc/shadow` for password storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Secure Applications:**  \n",
    "  Applicable in any scenario requiring robust password hashing.\n",
